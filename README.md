🏦 Simple Bank Management System (C++ Console App)
🛠 Overview
This is a Simple Bank Management System developed using C++ as a console application. The project was created to practice the fundamentals of programming, focusing on key concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), variables, control flow (if-else, loops), and data structures. The system simulates basic banking operations, including account management, deposits, withdrawals, and balance checking, through a user-friendly console interface.

✨ Key Features
👤 Account Management
Create a new account.

Deposit money into accounts.

Withdraw money from accounts.

Check account balance.

💳 Simple Transactions
Perform deposits and withdrawals.

Display balance after each transaction.

📈 Basic Operations
Menu-based interface with options to:

Open account

Deposit/Withdraw money

Check balance

Exit the program

Loop through the menu until the user chooses to exit.

🧮 Key Concepts Implemented
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Account information is stored as an object.

Functions like deposit, withdraw, and check balance are part of the Account class.

Control Flow:

Conditional Statements (if-else) to handle different cases (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawal).

Loops (while, for) to allow repeated actions (e.g., going back to the main menu).

Variables & Data Types:

Use of int for account balance and double for monetary values.

File Handling (Optional):

The program can be extended to save account information to a text file (though this is not part of the basic implementation).

✅ Additional Features (Optional for future versions)
Account balance history tracking.

Implement interest calculation for savings accounts.

File-based account data storage (saving/loading account details).

🚀 Technologies Used
C++ for application logic

Console Application for user interaction

⚠️ Important Notice
This application is intended purely for educational purposes and is a simple demonstration of basic programming concepts in C++. It does not interact with any external databases or real banking systems.
